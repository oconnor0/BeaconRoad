"The doors. The doors," the blue robed officiant intoned.

Two hooded figures began closing the large wooden doors at the back of the nave. A second later the doors splintered open, and a trio of masked figures stepped into the room. A crisp cold light shone forth from the gun of the mask on the right, piercing the warm candleit glow in the room. The chanting from the front of the room continued as the two robed figures were dragged to the front, gurgling and spitting blood.

The mask in front barkeds, "Get out here, old man!" as he walked up the steps to the altar.

The robed man set his book down, turned arouind, ans tepped out the door of the altar. "Sir Malcolm, Keeper of the Hidden Locks, what brings you here and now and in such a violent manner?"

"Your blasphemy, your debauchery, your cannibalism comes to an end this morning. The High Primarch has signed a denunciation of your miserable little cult. Number two, read the accusations."

The mask on the left stepped forward, pulled out a parchment, and read, ".... Do you recant?"

The old man straightened his frame, a faint glow around him, and responded, "By the grace of Our Mother, I will never recant."

"Then you shall die."

With a smile, "I am already dead."

"Line them up."

The other two masks lined the remaining seven monks up, kneeling to the altar in the east. Starting with the first, the youngest, the mask holding the official denunciation asked, "Do you recant, renounce, and repudiate the entirety of the teaching of The Church of the Murdered Exile?"

The young man's eyes downcast never wavered but no word came from his mouth.

The mask repeated himself, staring.

"He is forbidden from speaking to outsiders." The woman next to him whispered.

"Old man, release him from his vow and give him a chance to live."

"His vow is to God" said the old man.

With a gesture from Sir Malcolm, the third mask slit the youngest monk's throat. And the monk fell to the fllor, a poolof blood staining the ancient planks.

The second stepped in front of the next month, repeated his question, and waited.

"I will never recant," and she fell to the floor, her blood mingling with his.

With the death of each, the old man made a gesture over thier bodies and whispered under his breath. Each time, Sir Malcolm struck him.

The third and the fourth, a man and a woman, recanted and were bound to be lead out. The blood of the fifth mingled on the ground. The sixth apostatized.

"Well, old man, what have you to say?"

"I have often prayed that when this day came that I would have the strength to faithfully endure. I have lived my life in service to God and His Church. I pray, XX, that you will repent of you fear. Shall we not fear Him who can cast our souls into hell rather than those here who can only would our bodies?

No, what joy is there in lying? What joy in recanting? All you can offer is a lie, a threat at gunpoint.

I pray for your salvation."

"Farewell, brother." And with a flick of his wrist, the old man collapsed on the floor and gurgled out his last breath.

From in the altar, an enormous crack resounded.

"Strip the living of their robes and necklaces." Turning to the three remaining living monastics, "Recant in word and deed and you will live to see another day. Fail to do so and your death will be worse than those here."

In minutes, the temple stood empty.

The blood dripped slowly. The doors hung off their hinges. The wind whistled through the room causing the few remaining candles to flicker in the draft. One by one the candles guttered out. The icons faded to nothing as dark engulfed the room. The chalice and spear rusted to powder. The altar and iconostasis cracked and crumbled to the ground. The walls and ceiling collapsed in a clouid of rubble as the age of a thousand years consumed the building in moments. Vines sprouted and twisted over the rock that once was the temple. By midnight all that remained was a single wooden cross weeping blood. In an evening a monastery that had stood for a thousand years, the first church in Beacon and its last bastion were wiped fromt he face of the world - its members slaughtered or apostasized, its buildings gone, its memory forgotten - erased from the minds of those in the city.

And the city shuddered, its people groaned, its children wept, and none slept. The next morning the city groaned awake and wondered what had happened. Everyone's feeds and view of the world rambled pointlessly on what transpired the night before. Had people's sleep regulation implants malfunctioned? Has their network links suffered a faulty upgrade? Had the EM field supporting the pervasive network pulsed or been hacked? Had rogue shamans touched spirits that must not be touched? Was the king testing new weapons technologies? Was the end coming?

But everyone's guesses missed reality - because grace fled when the church collapsed.

Slowly cracks in the deep began to form and that which should not be slithered forth to consume the world. The moons began to fade, their color drawn out. The skies darkened. The nights turned inky black which little light would pierce. Minds opened to a reality that had heretofore never existed. Minds connected with each other, with the physical world, with spirits, and with something beyond.
