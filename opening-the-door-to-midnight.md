As mankind advance, it dominaed every aspect of reality, bending it to their will. Little remained outside out domain. Only umanity's need to sleep and the starling inefficacy of gene therapy - on humans - remained. As the spirits of creation awakened, we became aware that our souls remained tethered to the World Beyond. only one way to break that tether and assert our dominance remained. And Ellington A opened the Doors to Midnight to allow us to ascend.

"The edited rats have been awake for 3 months without deleterious effect, mental or physical degradation. Their productivity has more than doubled. I see no reason that we could not begin human trials."

"No human test subject has remained awak for longer than 3 days before the split begins."
"The split?"
"It's what we call this division between their vitals, blood work, sensor reports, brain chemistry, implant status (all of which look perfect) and their sanity (which erodes into hallucination, delusion, and madness)."
"But how is that possible? What are you missing?"
"We don't know. We've tried variant edits, but everything else is worse, much worse."

"When the spirits of creation began to manifest, we began to study them and to track them. I hypothesized that some spiritual connection interfered with humanity's ability to stay awake. After we developed Ghost Resonance Imaging, I was able to determine that the humans' spirit is connected in someway to their body and that connection frays without sleep. Utilizing this information we tried both severing the spirit and tightening the tether, neither of which offered satisfactory results. Severing the spirit caused near immediate insanity, tanked the host's ability to think, but enabled them to stay awake for up to a month before they wholly succumbed ato madness. Tightening the tether extended the host's ability to remain awak without deleterious effect to up to a week."
"A sleeping human can neither work nor consume. We need a superior approach."

"Our archaelogical team in (Bolivia, South America; in a flooded lake; on the ocean floor) has uncovered an ancient door. Physical sensors have been unable to ascertain anything about what is beyond the door. Spiritual sensors have detected ties, tethers from each person nearby, toward, through the door. It also appears that similar tethers from each liveing person pass through this door. The strength of the tether appears proportional to their vicinity to the door.
"This is the first direction connection we have found that might up us unlock the individual's spirit. Unfortunately, we have no idea how to open the door or what might be on the other side."
"We suspect a connection to the World Beyond."
