Editor's note:

I present the following journals collected and collated frmo the Archives to provide, after far too long, the fnial word on our of out city's great heroes gone amiss. I have kept my edits to a minimum, fixicing only grammar or spellng where necessary. The included footnotes are largely of my own collectioni in an attmept to clarify points in the journals that would otherwise be uninitelliigelbe to a mmodern reader. I hope that I have capture the whole of Tristen without blemish.

By the will of God and for His Eminence Patriarches Moises,
Brother Julien of the ??? Monastery

Her blood was on my hand again, weeping through my pores, a continual reminider of m most recent failure. I scrubbed m handers under the water, pretending I could thus absolve myself. In truth I could only wait ,thiis flow would subside, allowing me once again the illusion of cleanliness. Alas I know the truth, I must always know the truth, I am unclean. I am a sin-eater.

It has been twenty-four years since I was tonsured, three more since my vows. Has it truly been seven since I lost her?  God, I miss her. Her death cuts me deeper than his ever did. [1]

[1] Tristen is referring to the two other sin-eaters under his command as Chaplain: Valerien and Dominguez.

The blood has finally stopped. My hands are clean again. The duration and frequency has been increasing. I shall have to investigate the phenomenon. Am I simply trapped or is there a means of purification? Unfortunately there are few Librarians who will allow a man with blood on his hands to search the Archives or to touch any books, much less one who has been anathematized. Nevertheless I shall have to determine what I can about my afflication, its cause, and its solution.

Started my journey toward Beacon as I know of no other Libraries or Archives that could contain what I need. The Elders in the western mountans are unlikely to have much relevant to a sin-eater, and I doubt I would be able to obtain access to any of their fasts after what happened to Valerien, rather after what I did to her.

I arrived in early afternoon in a small village on the outskirts of the Black Forest. As I walked up, the locals watched warily at my arrival. Few welcome a lone sin-eater these days. A gnarled man approached me, uttered the customary greeting, warded himself, and asked "Can you handle some wolves?" Answering in the affirmative, he then continued "Aye, good, follow me." After a short walk, he took me to their village's sheep pens. The scene was a disaster, maybe three sheep remained living in a pen made for sixty. The blood, viscera, and bone was spread everywhere. The man grunted, "We'll be dead if this continues. Been going on two weeks. Lost my brother's boy to the wolves." After a pause, "it's worth a night's stay and the best food we got." He spat and watched me carefully. After I brief survey of the scene, I rose, saying "I'll see you tonight. I hope your food is a good as you claim."

Stalking the fiends was quick work, they left complete mayhem wherever they went. These were no wolves. Sadly, they never are.

I shall endeavor to record thiis battle in full, for smoething of it disturbs me greatly. Perhaps in the writing I shall ken what that may be.
