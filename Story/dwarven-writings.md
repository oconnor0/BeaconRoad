# Journals 

## From the journal of Durgun, Rightful Heir to the Holdfast, on Tuesday, April 6, 984 winters after the fall of the Holdfast, 1257 winters after its founding,

The cold stone of the storage room we have been holed up in for the last day has been an odd contrast to warmth of the forge below. I miscalculated our ability to hold the forge, the lower quarters, and this storage room. We had held the goblin raiders at bay for the better part of a week, slowly building our armory and reinforcing the doors. Yesterday, in the dead of night, I woke to a small knock coming from the far wall of the forge. As I sat up, the wall exploded in fire and rubble as a horde of goblins broke through. It is still not obvious to me how they were able to tunnel so close to the forge wall without anyone hearing it. Regardless, the goblins had killed half a dozen sleeping dwarves before the rest of us were able to wake and hold them off long enough to escape back to this room. We barricaded ourselves in, but time is running out. I expect the goblins will have another blasting charge in the next day or so to break through this door. Their first attempt failed. Thankfully Hrothgar's reinforcing of this door proved sufficient. I fear we are trapped without a way out. I must find a way.

The burden of leadership hangs heavy. Already seven of the twelve dwarves who entered the Holdfast with me are dead. I see the fear in the eyes of my companions. I hear their uncertainty in the whispers of their conversations. Would that those seven had not died, but the signs and portents in the heavens make clear what I must do. The Holdfast must be reclaimed or all shall perish in fire and ruin.

I miss the smell of my wife's hair. Copper and apple.

## On the Cosmological Role of Dwarves

### What is our purpose? For what were we created?

We were created for two purposes: to keep the twelve citadels until the end; and to tend the earth and bring technology to its peoples.

### Why are there twelve citadels?

For the same reason there are twelve signs in the heavens or twelve kings of the dwarves, because all things must have their proper place and proper division. Nothing remains forever ascendant, even the stars in the heavens.

### From whence did the sky ziggurats come?

The thirteen sky ziggurats, of which the Sky Ziggurat of Shul-zukam is the greatest, floated down from the north ages ago, a dark mockery of our citadels.

### Oft are we asked by those not dwarves, "Why do you hide your women away and keep them far from our eyes?"

Do they not know? We have not been given women as the other peoples have. We do not have women we can parade in front of others, flaunting her beauty, and tempting others to steal her. We alone of all the peoples have been given creation as our wife. She is ours to tend and to care for. We are to watch over her and to ensure that what she births brings life and not destruction. She must be tended to so that she does not create chaos.

### What is our aim?

Long ago we were given twelve citadels to tend and to keep as a bastion against the encroaching darkness. For a brief time we stood in those twelve citadels against the dark, a light shining, tending to creation. But alas one is lost forever. Six have been captured. Only five remain ours. Before we perish and before the end comes, we must reclaim those six citadels.

### We have invented the most wondrous technology. Why do we not use it as the other peoples do?

Technology is a viper that would kill us as quickly as it would kill our enemies. Technology increases the power of he who wields it, and yet he is weakened without it. This is the cruel joke that the demons have played upon the earth. Offering technology, seemingly for free, to destroy the other peoples. We use technology only when no other solution will suffice. We do not blast holes in the earth when picks will suffice. We do not inscribe casks with the words of preservation when salt will do. We do not use a steam engine when a donkey will do, and we do not use a donkey when we will do. We do not hunt with a musket when a bow or a spear or a knife will do. To grasp beyond what we have been given, to strive for power or dominion or even more, is not our place. We must not fall into pride as the other peoples do.

### What is the role of greed in the life of our people?

Greed is a fell thing. It has been given to us that we might care for the earth, that we might strive to tend it, rather than simply delve into the depths and ignore it. That which glitters neither fills nor satisfies. And yet, many terrible wars have been started by a dwarf king hungry for that which he can never eat, ravenous for what will never satisfy. Unfettered greed tells us that we can, that we must have whatever we desire, that we are appointed to take it. This is the greed that created the giants, that challenges the stars, that desolates the land.

### Where do the giants come from?

The giants are our progeny. The mixture of dwarven and demonic blood. The other peoples have spawned their own abominations, but the giants are ours. As such they are ours to suffer.

### Then from whence do the goblins come?

In days long past, the goblins came from the north in twisted mockery of us. Where we invented carefully and slowly, they invented without consequence. Where we delved with care and tended the land with patience, they mined without regard and pillaged the land. Nothing lives, nothing grows in their wake.

## On the Bull of Heaven

### Why do we venerate the Forge-father and Hearth-mother?

We venerate those better than us, those who rule us, those who tend to us as we tend to the earth. We were given the twelve dwarven kings to rule us and the kings were given two stars to rule them. He guides us to the east, a beacon in the night. She follows from the west, covering our frailty.

### Why do we not worship as the other peoples do?

The First Citadel was given to us as the only place we may sacrifice. We lost the only place that we could to sacrifice when we lost the First Citadel. And as it is barred from us until the remaking of the earth, we are barred from sacrifice. Graciously, we have not been prevented from offering incense.

The name of the First Citadel is Birtu-ina-Agru (Citadel-within-Aries/the Ram).
Aries/Ram is the first month on the dwarven calendar starting at spring equinox.

### Why were we given only one place to sacrifice?

Inscrutable mysteries are rarely worth pondering.

### Could we not sacrifice to the Bull of Heaven or any of the gods of the other peoples?

If we choose to sacrifice to the Bull of Heaven, we choose to sacrifice to a god not given to us, to a demon. To eat with the Bull of Heaven is to become like him, to become a giant.

Bull of Heaven = Alu-al/elan/elat/eli/ser-Asratu/Burumu/Samhu/Setu = Alu-al-Asratu
nip≈°u - snorting of the bull of heaven

Forge-father = Nappahu/Tebiru-abu/abutu = Tebirabu, Tebiru-abu
Hearth-mother = Kanunu/Musahhinu-aggarinu/bantu/garrinu/ummu = Kanunu-ummu, Kanunummu

### Is not the Bull of Heaven our rightful guardian and worthy master? Is not the Forge-father a weak imitation?

The Bull of Heaven is stronger than all others. Dominant and never submissive. He runs roughshod over the world and keeps the Serpent of the Deep in her place. And, truly, that Serpent must be kept at bay. But the Bull is a tyrant. He does not keep the Serpent in the deeps because she must be kept their or creation will perish. He keeps her there that he may crush the land beneath his hooves.

We must ever take care that we do not forget our place. Ours is not to crush the world. Ours is not to refuse to submit. Ours is not to rule as tyrants but to serve as kings. We were made at the beginning and given to the Forge-father to shepherd creation into maturity. We must work with the Hearth-mother to guide creation to flourishing.

Do not confuse patience and tenderness with weakness. The Bull of Heaven must be driven off. The Serpent of the Deep must be kept chained. We must stand between light and dark, between life and death, between heaven and hell. We must spend our lives against that which would destroy all of creation. We have been given a terrible doom. None of us will live to see creation in springtime, but without us there will be no spring.

### Why will we not see creation in springtime?

In former days we were not faithful. We hoarded wealth instead of stewarding it. We united ourselves with the Bull of Heaven and made war on the other peoples. We gave birth to the feldwarves. We abandoned the Forge-father and Hearth-mother. A doom was placed upon us. Our wives were taken from us. With each passing age, fewer dwarves are born and fewer of those are women. Eventually the last dwarf will be born. And there will be no more.

### What will happen when the last dwarf dies?

When the last dwarf dies, the end will come. The earth will be consumed in fire and reborn.

### What if we do not recapture our ancestral citadels before the end?

We have not been told what will happen if we fail in our task. We could speculate, but that would be to reach beyond what we can know. If we assume our task is optional and fail, we shall suffer justly.
