XP TRIGGERS!


    * At the end of a session, mark 1 XP if you struggled with issues from your Vice. Mark XP for this if your Vice tempted you to some bad action. Simply Indulging your Vice doesn’t count as struggling with it (unless you overindulge).
    * At the end of a session, mark 1 XP if you struggled with issues from your Virtue. Mark XP for this if your Virtue drove you toward some good action that complicated the situation. Simply Exemplifying your Vice doesn’t count as struggling with it.
* Virtue:
    * **Industry.**
        * Nothing is impossible with hardwork, elbow grease, and unflagging endurance.
* Vice:
    * **Greed.**
        * You are drawn to have and to possess the riches of the earth.

# Character Advancement

Characters advance by gaining XP which they may use to increase their Skill Ratings or to gain additional Special Abilities. Gaining XP, and thus character advancement, is completely in the control of the player. Characters learn not from their successes but from their failures, from player-introduced complications. This is handled mechanically by XP Triggers.

## XP Triggers

All characters have access to the following XP Trigger:

* When you Push Yourself and Fail an Action Roll, mark 1 XP in the Attribute for the Skill you rolled.

Vice XP Triggers

* If you voluntarily Botch a social interaction because of your Pride, mark 1 XP.

Virtue

* If you voluntarily Botch an attempt to deceive, or if you report an ally, because of your Integrity, mark 1 XP.

Male power is about overcoming any obstacle. Female power is about being believed -no matter what. It's that simple. Though ultimately, it's the difference between power as an effect of controlling self vs power and an effect of controlling others. And that sort of control of others lends women to crave being the villain or at least, the grand manipulator. It's been the same for ages: broken promises, hidden intentions, devastating secrets. Even the Greeks knew what was up. There is no female power fantasy that isn't either narcissistic or that makes her into a total cunt. Male power comes in overcoming objective reality. Female power comes in defining subjective reality.

“Being powerful is like being a lady. If you have to tell people you are, you aren't.” - Margaret Thatcher

Tywin Lanister said: "he who has to say I am the king is no true king"

The masculine stops death. The feminine creates life. Both are necessary for flourishing.

Fighter:

Combat Challenge
In combat, it’s dangerous to ignore a fighter. Every
time you attack an enemy, whether the attack hits or
misses, you can choose to mark that target. The mark
lasts until the end of your next turn. While a target
is marked, it takes a –2 penalty to attack rolls for any
attack that doesn’t include you as a target. A creature
can be subject to only one mark at a time. A new mark
supersedes a mark that was already in place.
In addition, whenever a marked enemy that is
adjacent to you shifts or makes an attack that does not
include you, you can make a melee basic attack against
that enemy as an immediate interrupt.

Combat Superiority
You gain a bonus to opportunity attacks equal to your
Wisdom modifier. An enemy struck by your opportunity
attack stops moving, if a move provoked the
attack. If it still has actions remaining, it can use them
to resume moving.

Fighter Weapon Talent
Choose either one-handed or two-handed weapons.
When using a weapon of your chosen style, you gain a
+1 bonus to attack rolls.
